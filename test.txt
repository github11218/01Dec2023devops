The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy. 
For example:
~~~
$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:

    new file:   style.css

Changes not staged for commit:

    modified:   index.html

$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 5002d47 our new homepage
HEAD is now at 5002d47 our new homepage

$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
~~~
