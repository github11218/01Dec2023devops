# Git stash
~~~
git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, 
and then come back and re-apply them later on. Stashing is handy if you need to quickly switch context and work on something else,
but you're mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.
